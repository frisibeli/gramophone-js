  ##Short project description (Business needs and system features)

  **Gramophone** is a social media player that lets you share music across limitless people, devices and speakers, whether they're in the same channel or halfway across the world. The system will be developed as a *Single Page Application (SPA)* using ***React.js*** as front-end, and ***Node.js + express + socket.io*** as backend technologies.

  The main user roles (actors in UML) are:

  • *Anonymous User* – can create, share & join channels. Add songs to the playlist.

  • *Registered User* – can create, share & join channels. Can also send messages in the channel, save songs to their personal playlist and add songs to the channel playlist.
